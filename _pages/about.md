Hi👋! I am a senior undergraduate student from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. 

My research interest lies in the scientific understanding of foundation models and their applications. I am very grateful to be advised by [Prof. Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/). Currently, I am working on foundational understanding of the Transformer's length generalization ability. I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Zhiwei Xu](https://zhiweixx.github.io/). Previously, I was a member of [URPS](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/undergraduate-students/undergraduate-research-opportunities-.html), gratefully supervised by [Prof. Yixin Wang](https://yixinwang.github.io/).
